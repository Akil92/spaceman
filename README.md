# Spaceman by: Akil Maynard
Spaceman is a guessing game created around words. The player will guess one letter at time while trying to figure out what the word is. There are 5 allowed guesses allowed. The player is only penalized if they guess an incorrect letter, minusing their guess by one. Reveal the word in under 5 guesses and your're the winner. If you can't figure the word out in under 5 guesses, you lose the game.
